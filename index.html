        </p>
      

        <h2>1. Make time for rest
        </h2>
        <p>Before you learn how to be better, it’s important to start with the basics. You need to have your basic needs met before you move on to self-improvement. Part of that is to make time for rest and self-care.
        </p>
        <p>There are many <a href="#">different types of rest.</a>  Are there moments in your schedule where you have the opportunity to do nothing and take a break? Those quiet moments of rest can help you decompress and process what happened in your day.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Read more books
        </h2>
        <p>There are books on virtually everything. So, reading more books can help you explore your current interests, but also develop new ones. You can even learn a new skill with a book.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="#">Some books</a> are written specifically to help you start working on self-improvement and personal growth. You can also <a href="#">read to improve your leadership skills.</a>
        </p>

        <p>But even getting deeply engrossed in a fiction novel can do wonders for you. The bottom line is that whatever passions you may have (or be curious about), carve out some time to read about them.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. Start a gratitude practice
        </h2>

        <p>One way to learn how to be a better person is by being grateful for what you have.
        </p>

        <p>You don’t have to feel grateful about huge things, either. Try to notice the small things that make you happy and make you feel grateful.
        </p>

        <p>You can fine-tune your gratitude practice over time. With practice, it gets easier to naturally think of what you’re grateful for. <a href="#">This new perception can change your life for the better.</a>
